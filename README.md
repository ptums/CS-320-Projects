# CS-320 Projects

In this repository, I have compiled a collection of files that showcase my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. This portfolio consists of submissions from two projects, each highlighting different aspects of my skills and expertise. Additionally, you will find reflections on my work, which provide valuable context for future reference.

## Project One

Files:
- `Appointment.java`-
- `AppointmentService.java`
- `AppointmentTest.java`
- `AppointmentServiceTest.java`
- `Contact.java`
- `ContactService.java`
- `ContactTest.java`
- `ContactServiceTest.java`
- `Task.java`
- `TaskService.java`
- `TaskTest.java`
- `TestServiceTest.java`

In Project One, I worked on ensuring every class achieved 100% coverage in terms of classes, methods, and lines. By trying to get 100% coverage, I exercised my ability to create unit tests that uncovered unforseen errors, analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet those requirements.

## Project Two - Software Testing and Automation

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
### How do I approach designing software?
