# CS-320 Projects

In this repository, I have compiled a collection of files that showcase my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. This portfolio consists of submissions from two projects, each highlighting different aspects of my skills and expertise. Additionally, you will find reflections on my work, which provide valuable context for future reference.

Project One - Software Testing and Automation
Files:
- `Contact.java`
- `ContactService.java`
- `ContactTest.java`
- `ContactServiceTest.java`
- `Tasks.java`
- `TasksService.java`
- `TasksTest.java`
- `TasksServiceTest.java`
In Project One, I worked on testing and automation in software development. These files demonstrate my ability to create unit tests using code to uncover errors, analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet those requirements.
